# Short-Form Video — Audio Sync + Retime Protocol

**Load this file when:** audio is re-edited after scenes were authored, OR an existing reel needs re-syncing, OR scene timestamps are drifting.

## Audio-sync protocol (DO NOT skip)

**Problem:** if audio is edited (retakes/pauses removed), timestamps in the source transcript no longer match the edited video. Scene starts authored in original-time will fire late.

**The rule:** ALL timing lives in edited-time. Never mix.

**Verification procedure for any short-form retime:**

1. Measure both audio files:
   ```bash
   ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration -of csv=p=0 assets/original.mp4
   ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration -of csv=p=0 assets/<name>-edit.mp4
   ```
   Difference = total cut time.
2. If using a `shift()` function in `captions.html` to map transcript words, treat that as the source of truth. The map `shift(originalTime) = editedTime` applies to EVERY scene `data-start` too.
3. Scene internal offsets (inside `compositions/sceneN.html`) are LOCAL relative to the scene's `data-start`. If a scene's parent `data-start` is correct in edited-time, internal offsets stay correct WITHOUT modification — UNLESS a scene straddles a cut, in which case both the parent duration AND internal offsets shift.
4. Face-mode transition array times MUST use edited-time. They are NOT automatically shifted.

**Plan format for retimes** (use this table structure every time):

| Scene | Current start | Current dur | New start | New dur | Rationale |
|-------|---------------|-------------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| ...   | ...           | ...         | ...       | ...     | ...       |

Then the face-mode array, then any internal-offset changes, then frame-verification list.

## Retime protocol (when audio is re-edited or timestamps drift)

1. Measure old and new edited audio durations with `ffprobe`. Delta = total cut time.
2. Identify cut window(s): which seconds were removed, from where.
3. Write the Plan table: every scene `data-start`, `data-duration`, every face-mode transition `t`, any scene whose internal offsets straddle a cut.
4. For each scene that straddles a cut, both its parent duration AND its internal offsets change. Scenes entirely on one side of the cut just need parent `data-start` shifted.
5. Lint → draft render → word-exact frame verify → final render. No shortcuts.

**GATE 0 retime exception:** if Allen re-edits audio AFTER scenes locked, scenes straddling the new cut must be re-previewed via `/scene-animation` before proceeding.
